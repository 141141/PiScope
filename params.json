{"name":"PiScope","tagline":"Turn your Raspberry Pi into an Oscilloscope/XY Plotter","body":"# PiScope: Turn your Raspberry Pi into an Oscilloscope/XY Plotter\r\n\r\nAn **oscilloscope** is a laboratory instrument commonly used to display and analyze the waveform of electronic signals. In effect, the device draws a graph of the instantaneous signal voltage as a function of time.\r\n\r\nA **XY Plotter** is an instrument to plot a voltage variable with respect to another voltage variable. This is in contrast to the oscilloscope which plots a voltage variable with respect to time.\r\n\r\nThis python library can turn your **Raspberry Pi** into an Oscilloscope or XY plotter. Simply, interface an **Analog to Digital Converter** with your Raspberry Pi and use the library to view the analog signals on your Raspberry Pi. Currently, the library supports Adafruit ADS1015 breakout board.\r\n\r\n\r\n![](https://learn.adafruit.com/system/guides/images/000/000/195/medium800/summary.jpg)\r\n*Raspberry Pi with ADS1015*\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nOscilloscope are costly, bulky. I wanted to monitor analog sensors on Raspberry Pi and I didn't had an actual oscilloscope. Not exactly precise, but it could be very helpful for most applications.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n*Hardware*\r\n\r\n1. Raspberry Pi B/B+/2\r\n\r\n2. [ADS1015 Breakout board Analog to Digital converter](http://www.adafruit.com/product/1083)\r\n\r\n*Software*\r\n\r\n1. Python 2.7\r\n\r\nThe following python modules are needed in order to use this library:\r\n\r\n```\r\npylab\r\nmatplotlib\r\nTkinter\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Interfacing ADS1015 with Raspberry Pi\r\n\r\n1. Connect Adafruit ADS1015 to Raspberry Pi\r\n> GND to GND, 5V to 5V, SDL to SDL, SCL to SCL, ADDR to GND (I2C address 0x48)\r\n2. Check the devices connected to the I2C bus using the command below\r\n> The Adafruit ADS1015 should be shown at: \r\n```sh\r\n$ sudo i2cdetect -y 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you need help in interfacing, check out the official documentation from Adafruit:\r\n\r\nhttps://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-4-gpio-setup/configuring-i2c\r\n\r\nhttps://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-4-channel-adc-breakouts/\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Raspberry-Pi-Python-Code \r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo turn your Raspberry Pi into an *Oscilloscope* using this library, just clone the repository and use the following code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom PiScope import Plotter\r\n\r\npiscope = Plotter()\r\n\r\npiscope.setup([0]) # Here, the channel used on ADS1015 is channel 0.\r\n\r\npiscope.plot()\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### OR\r\n\r\nUse example_oscilloscope.py available with the repository.\r\n```sh\r\n$ python example_oscilloscope.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo turn your Raspberry Pi into an *XY Plotter* using this library, just clone the repository and use the following code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom PiScope import Plotter\r\n\r\npiscope = Plotter()\r\n\r\npiscope.setup([0, 1]) # Here, the channels used on ADS1015 are channel 0 (X) and channel 1 (Y).\r\n\r\npiscope.plot()\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### OR\r\n\r\nUse example_xyplotter.py available with the repository.\r\n```sh\r\n$ python example_xyplotter.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Dry Test\r\n\r\nIn case you don't own a Raspberry Pi or ADS1015 yet, but want to see the library in action, I have included a dry test example, which doesn't require any hardware. You can simply run it on any Linux/Windows platform.\r\n\r\nUse example_drytest.py available with the repository.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ python example_drytest.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Example results\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ankitaggarwal011/PiScope/master/example_oscilloscope.png)\r\n*Oscilloscope*\r\n\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ankitaggarwal011/PiScope/master/example_xyplotter.png)\r\n*XY Plotter*\r\n\r\n## API\r\n```python\r\nfrom PiScope import Plotter\r\n```\r\nImport the module in your main file.\r\n\r\n```python\r\npiscope = Plotter()\r\n```\r\nCreate oscilloscope/XY Plotter\r\n\r\n#### piscope.setup(channels)\r\nSetup the channels of ADS1015 being used for oscilloscope/XY Plotter.\r\n\r\nchannels is the channels of ADS1015 which are to be used, Type: List/Array of 1 or 2 Integers.\r\n\r\ne.g. In case of an oscilloscope, channels is a list with one element representing the active ADS1015 channel (channels = [channel_number]).\r\n\r\ne.g. In case of an oscilloscope, channels is a list with two elements representing the active ADS1015 channels (channels = [channel_number_X, channel_number_Y]).\r\n\r\n#### piscope.plot()\r\nPlot the analog values on the oscilloscope/XY Plotter.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\n#### Author: Ankit Aggarwal\r\n\r\nIf anybody is interested in working on developing this library, fork and feel free to get in touch with me.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n[MIT License](https://github.com/ankitaggarwal011/PiScope/blob/master/LICENSE)","google":"UA-59109394-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
